Title: Nikes

Special shoutout to the icon dynasty, Slip-N-Slide Records
I got two versions, I got two versions, I got two versions

These bitches want Nikes (This is a setup)
They looking for a check (Oh my god)
Tell em it ain't likely (This bitch tryna set me up)
Said she need a ring like Carmelo (Hands up, oh my god)
Must be on that white like Othello (Oh my, it's a real life angel)
All you want is Nikes (Yeah)
But the real ones just like you (Tell these niggas)
Just like me (Tell these guys you ain't basic)

I don't play, I don't make time
(Tell these guys you wear Zanottis, you a hottie, this is heaven on earth)
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line
(But if you're in the party don't bring your shotty
Love everybody)
Pour up for A$AP (rest in peace)
RIP Pimp C (rest in peace)
RIP Trayvon, a nigga look just like me
Woo, f*ckin' buzzin', woo!
(Remember one thing, remember one thing: don't take no photos in the party)
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
(That's rule number one
Rule number two: don't take no photos in the party)
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
(Rule number three: I got one left)
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath
Weighted down
(If you in the-)
Punk madre, punk papa
(If you couldn't get to the-, go your ass to sleep, we in the-)
He don't care for me
(Special shoutout to them live niggas at Rap-A-Lot records)
But who cares for me
(We keep it hot)
And that's good enough
(I've been working on my bod, I feel hot)
We don't talk much or nothin'
(If we in the- holla at ya gwalla)
But when we talkin' about something
(Oh my god, hold up)
We have good discussion
(Tell these basic bitches we don't wear Nike)
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something
(You guys are naughty, you a hottie, hold up)
That's good for us

We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a f*cking Yarmulke
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles in the glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
The only human in this humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're f*cking him too



Title: Ivy

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
It started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a f*ck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
It started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to... meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
It started from nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
And we started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

All the things I didn't mean to say
I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
You didn't need to... need to
I could dream all night
Dream all night
I could drive all night
Drive all night
Dreaming, dream on



Title: Pink + White

[Frank Ocean:]
Yeah, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah yeah

That's the way everyday goes
Every time we have no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Half way on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool in this good life
Won't let you down when it's all ruined

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Good Glory, dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower, milk crate
It's the same way you showed me
Cannon ball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it up when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Where God could fear
It's all downhill from here

[Frank Ocean & Beyonc√©:]
What a life, remember how it was, climb trees, Michael Jackson, all in shit
(We've come) Say what up to Magic, just shoot
Say what up to daddy
Say what up to life, I found it
And I know what you might want to know
Run from me and your team
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy)
Give me somethin sweet
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin
This is life, life immortality



Title: Be Yourself

[Frank's Mom:]
Many college students have gone to college and gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol. Listen, stop trying to be somebody else. Don't try to be someone else. Be yourself and know that that's good enough. Don't try to be someone else. Don't try to be like someone else, don't try to act like someone else, be yourself. Be secure with yourself. Rely and trust upon your own decisions. On your own beliefs. You understand the things that I've taught you. Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs. Don't use that cocaine or marijuana because that stuff is highly addictive. When people become weed-heads they become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned. Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned. That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom. Unless you're taking it under doctor's - umm- control. Then it's regulated. Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol, do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye



Title: Solo

Hand me a towel I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo
One time
We too loud in public then police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Red-bone, so mellow
F*ck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy city that night
No trees to blow through
But blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sunrise
Smoking good, rolling solo

Solo, solo
Solo, solo
S-solo, solo
S-solo, solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo

I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as f*ck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, cause it's enough cost, that clinic kill my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her Pickett fence
And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo

It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, inhale, that's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
By myself
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
(By myself, by myself)
Solo, solo
Solo, solo



Title: Skyline To

[Frank Ocean (Kendrick Lamar):]
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your medal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
"Look guys, Jacksons!"
That's a pretty f*cking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty f*cking
Underneath moon light now
Pretty f*cking
Sunrising, sand, comes a morning, haunting us with the beams
So it ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, hazy)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you call when I call again

On comes the evening
Both seeking ends
Peace in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carry the way
Because I'm stronger, congo is damned (smoke)
In comes the morning (smoke)
In comes the morning (haze)



Title: Self Control

Pool side convo about your summer last night, oh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mmm
Could I make it shine last night
Could I make it shine, on it last night, last night
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rare, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blinded life
Wish I was there, wish we had grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never cause I made you use your self control
And you made me lose my self control, my self control

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
(Nobody else, nobody else)
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it



Title: Good Guy

It's a good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
I, first time I done saw you
You text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
It's when I realized you talk too much, more than I do
I, it's highlights when I was convinced
That it isn't much more it's so not you
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

This nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna f*ck you nigga

He told me

I used to f*ck with all of 'em

Yeah I ain't got bitches no more

But now I don't care about bitches like that my nigga, that shit Jasmine f*cking wrecked my heart, I don't even know how to even feel about it



Title: Nights

Round the city
Round the clock
Everybody needs you
No you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Breath till I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust them anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (biiitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm f*ckin', no I'm f*cked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't trying to keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up
Did you call me from a seance
You are from a past life
Hope you're doing well bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal coming in and out
Hope you're doing well bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Oooh nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body
New beginnings ahh
New beginnings wake up akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day bruh
Can't keep being laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive the
Every night shit
The every day shit

Dropping baby off at home
Before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
Kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, don't want to die yeah
Wanna feel that na na though
Could you ride come by
After my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the f*ck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
My everyday shit, every night shit, my every day shit
Every night shit

All my life, been running from you all my life
Been waiting on you all my life
All my life, you've been missing all my life

Every night f*cks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God you should match it, it's that KO
No white lights til I f*ck my 28th up
In 1998 my family had that Acura, oh
The Legend, kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the Reverends
Preaching self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoneys on occasion
After trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
F*ckin on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night

Drop the baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit, Kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, we don't want to die yeah
Wanna feel that lovin' when you come by
F*ck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
Wanna see me bummed out
Stressed out
Everyday shit
Shut the f*ck up I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
Everyday shit, every night shit, every day shit
Every night shit



Title: Solo (Reprise)

Aye, aye, so now I'm

[Andre 3000:]
So-lo that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So-lo that I don't get high no more when I "Geronimo!" I just go hit
So-lo my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So-lo that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo it ain't an event
No more
So-lo that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do I cut the pony off, now there's a hole that once was a logo
How fitting
So-lo that I can give a f*ck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you Ann
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive but darling this only worsens
So-lo my halo, stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So-lo that when they throw pussy on pesos I pay no attention to it
So-lo that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment, watchin' the summer come close to an end
After 20 years in
I'm so naive I was under the impression that everyone wrote they own verses
It's comin' back different and yea that shit hurts me
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
I'm stumbled and lift every word, was I working just way too hard?



Title: Pretty Sweet

Now
To the edge I'll race you
To the end I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my four friends
We pour taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The hype right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you want to hold me now
You can't end me now
That might be what you need

(This side)
You wanna keep me now
(This side)
Don't let me down
(I'm on this side, I'm on this side, I'm on this side)
([?] on this side, [?])
(Fathers of the Earth be kind)
(To the mothers of whom we rely
(Fathers of Earth be kind)
(To the mothers of whom we rely)

(Ah-ah-ahhh, ah-ah-ahh, ah-ah-ahhhh)
(Ah-ah-ahhh, ah-ah-ahh, ah-ah-ahhhh)
We know your sucker
Pretty sweet-eeet
Pretty sweet-eeet



Title: Facebook Story

I was just telling that I got this girl before
And I was together since 3 years
And em, I was not even cheating on her or what
And Facebook arrived and she wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it because I was like in front of her
And she told me like "Accept me on Facebook"
It was virtual, made no sense
So I say "I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook"
She started to be crazy
She thoughts that because I didn't accept her
She thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, it's over
And I can't believe it
It is crazy because I like her
I'm in front of you, I'm every day
Here in your house
That's like jealousy
Pure jealousy for nothing
You know
Virtual thing



Title: Close To You

I will be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hand through this, baby
In my mind, I didn't need
Warned your ex
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
How much longer baby?
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to the saved kids
Just like mine versions of these belong to you
After a while
They're keeping me close to you

(Just like me, they long to be
Close to you)



Title: White Ferrari

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes
Watch the clouds float, white Ferrari
Had a good time
16: how was I supposed to know anything?
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari

Close by me
You will find
You will find me
Is this the slow body
Left when I forgot to speak
So I text to speech, lesser speeds
Texas speed, yes
Based takes it's toll on me
Eventually, eventually, yes
I only eventually, eventually, yes

I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari
Good times
In this life, life
In this life, life

One too many years
So taste what I lived on a facelift
Mind over matter is magic
I do magic
If you think about it it's over in no time the best life

Ooh, oooh, oooh, ooh
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're smaller and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
I'm up and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a scar, at least that's what they call it
And we're free to fall



Title: Seigfried

The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move
And settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave

I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell
(It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of a loop is a loop)

This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)

Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming a dream in a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think about dreaming a dream
Where I can not, where I can not
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod
Spin this flammable paper on the film's that my life
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon

(In the dark, in the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for



Title: Godspeed

I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)

Wishing you Godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
Until the time...
(This love will keep people blinded of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
'Till the time we die...
(This love will keep us still blinded by the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)

Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh



Title: Futura Free

If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could f*ck three times a day and not skip a meal I'm good
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Call my momma like momma
I ain't making minimum wage momma
I'm on momma
I'm on
Now I'm making 400, 600, 800k momma
To stand on my feet momma
Play these songs, it's therapy momma, they paying me momma
I should be paying them
I should be paying y'all honest to God
I'm just a guy I'm not a God
Sometimes I feel like I'm a God but I'm not a God
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me momma
Let me run this bitch
I'm a run it into the ground momma, the whole galaxy
God damn, f*ck these lames, they don't want none
F*ck these lames, they don't want none
F*ck these niggas
F*ck these niggas, they don't want none
F*ck these niggas
F*ck you niggas
F*ck me if I hated on you

I'm a stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga you got some just like me don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese
Roots run deep
Family tree, throw a big shadow, tech company
Please gimme immortality
I'm going rapidly
Fading drastically
Or pulled the zip down
Wet your lips first
Lick the tip now
Smoke some'n
Jamming to the rhythm it's a face to face
Keep me high castrati
Poonani fade the stress
Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway
They tryna find 2Pac
Don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press
He escape the stress
La da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da

I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga
Murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cut bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four door

Remember when I had that Lexus no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song so
I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Menage on my birthday
Tap out on the first stroke
Cause this ain't no work day
She don't give head anyway
Cause what niggas say
That's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas want fight in the streets now
Shit starting to make my head hurt
Jay hit me on the email
Said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now
Not fetch I ain't runnin for a nigga
Ain't ran since track meet
That's the only time I ran from a nigga
You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago
Know and know
