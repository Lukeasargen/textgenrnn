They look like twins
That was embarrassing

Title: Thinkin Bout You

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they bawl

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
(You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel?
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road
'Til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)



Title: Fertilizer

Fertilizer
I’ll take bullshit if that’s all you got
Some fertilizer
Fertilizer
Ooooooo



Title: Sierra Leone

We’re spending too much time alone
And I just ran out of trojans
Horses gallop to her throne
We’re behaving like teenagers
Making less than minimum wage
Still inside our parents’ home
No i dont live in denver
I grew up in sierra leone
And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra leone
Sierra leone
Tid bits of intuition that i been gettin
Abandon mission Abandon mission
You must be kidding
This shit feelin different
Shit feelin too good
To me glistenin
Shimmerin underneath the sunlight
And a new day
Will bring about the dawn
And anewday
Will bring another crying babe into the world
(Girl now)
Our daughters reaching for your nipple
Cause its time for her to eat
Tonight ill lay her in the cradle
If its time for go to sleep
I’ll sing a lennon lullaby
She can have a pretty dream
Baby girl if you knew what i know
Knew what i know



Title: Sweet Life

The best song wasn't the single
But you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights
The black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise
Palm trees and pools
The water's blue swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal
Whatever you like
Whatever feels good
Whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal
Not sugar-free my TV ain't HD that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes
A sweet life a sweet life sweet life
Sweet life sweet life
A sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
A sweet life a sweet life sweetie pie
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper
Since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world
When you got the beach
Don't know why see the world
When you got the beach
The sweet life
The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver
Can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting a wave
You're catching that breeze
'Til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal
Whatever you like
Whatever feels good
Whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal
Not sugar-free my TV ain't HD that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime
A sweet life a sweet life a sweet life
A sweet life a sweet life a sweet life
Live and die in the life
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper
Since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world
When you got the beach
Don't know why see the world
When you got the beach
And the water
Is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood
Is getting trippier every day
Neighborhood is going ape shit crazy
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper
Since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world
When you got the beach
Don't know why see the world
When you got the beach
The sweet life



Title: Not Just Money

Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'ma make more
No, no no no no no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have
Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Savin' my seven dollars



Title: Super Rich Kids

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, New girl
New ice, New glass
New watch good times babe
It's good times yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high
The help don't stare
They just walk by
They must don't care
A million one a million two
A hundred more will never do
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love
(Earl)
Close your eyes for what you can't imagine
We are the xany gnashing caddy smashing
Bratty ass he mad he snatched his daddy's jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams
With half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch keyed us
Toyin with raggy annes and mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck breaching all these aqueducts
Don't believe us treat us like we can't erupt
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
(Talkin bout)
Do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge
She grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times yeah
Sleeve rips off I slip I fall
The markets down like sixty stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love
(Ain't that something rare)
I'm searching for a real love
(Talkin bout real love)
Real love yea
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Talkin bout a real love



Title: Pilot Jones

[Intro]
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (high!)
Go head, fly that thing!
High! High!
But fly alone
[Verse 1]
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss around
[Hook]
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones
She took me high, then she took me home
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
[Verse 2]
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse and no I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while by the dealer
And the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
Buf if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'mma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my Pilot Jones



Title: Crack Rock

[Verse 1]
You don’t know how little you matter
Until you’re all alone
In the middle of Arkansas
With a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
Cause she was and you are madly involved
Madly involved
[Refrain x2]
Hitting stones in glass homes
You're smoking stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock
Crack rock crack rock
[Verse 2]
You're shuckin and jiving
Stealing and robbing
To get the fixing that you’re itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won’t let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky
[Refrain]
[Verse 3]
Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fucking pig get shot
Three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped
And don’t no one hear the sound
Don’t no one hear the rounds
Don’t no one hear the shells
Don’t no one hear a sound
Don’t no one disturb the peace for riot
Don’t no one disrupt nirvana
Don’t no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
How you feeling girl
How’s the gutter doing
Crack rock



Title: Pyramids

[Intro]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra
Run run run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty
We'll run to the future
Shining like diamonds in a rocky world
A rocky, rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to rhythm
On the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramid
Tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramid
Voices fill up the halls
[Repeat Intro]
The jewel of Africa
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me?
How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson
And his full head of hair
Found my black queen Cleopatra
Bad dreams, Cleopatra
Remove her
Send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more she lives no more serpent in her room
No more it has killed Cleopatra
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl for now, let's call her Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels
Catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne
Let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank
But it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
[Hook]
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet & you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more
But your love ain't free no more
[Hook]



Title: Lost

[Verse 1]
Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
(Yo we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Hook]
Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
Too weird to live, too rare to die
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She's at a stove
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope
I promise she'll be
Whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong
Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong)
No nothing wrong with a lie
Nothing wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky
Up in the sky
You and I
Just you and I

[Hook]

[Outro]
Love lost ?
Love love
Love lost ?
Love love
Love lost
Love love
Love lost
Life is the substance
Then the other channel on the



Title: White

could this be earth, could this be light
does this mean everythings going to be alright
one look out my window theres trees talking like people
i dreamt of storms, i dreamt of sound
i dreamt of gravity keeping us around
i slept in the darkness it was lonely and it was silent
what is this love, i dont feel the same
dont believe what this is, could be given a name
i awoke you there chasing planets on my forehead
but i forget 23 like i forget 17
and i forget my first love, like you forget a day dream
and what of all my wild friends, and the times i've had with them
but i'll fade to grey soon on the tv station



Title: Monks

[Verse 1]
Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
[Hook]
But you're beautiful to me
Wave 'em high girl to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
(We're in the clouds)
Wave 'em high girl to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
(Life in the clouds)
Keep em high y'all
(Beautiful stars)
In the sky
[Verse 2]
Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a run away young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, getaway
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhaya Mudra

I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We've got no choices left
The running's fast
Run run run run
You're beautiful to me
Run run run run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archer's bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end
[Hook]
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Keep 'em high y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me
Beautiful



Title: Bad Religion

Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter, running
Its rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons could you
He said Allah Hu Akbar
I told him don’t curse me
Bo bo you need prayer
I guess it couldn’t hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It’s a bad religion
This unrequited love
To me its nothing but a one man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me love me love me love me
Love me love me
Love me love me love me love
Taxi driver I swear i’ve got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can’t tell you the truth about my disguise
I can’t trust no one
And you say Allah Hu Akbar
I told him don’t curse me
Bo bo you need prayer
I guessed it couldn’t hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It’s a bad religion
Unrequited love
To me its nothing but a one man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
No no
It’s a it’s a bad religion
To be in love with
Someone who could never love you
Only bad only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do



Title: Pink Matter

[Frank Ocean]
And the peaches & the mangos
You could sell for me..
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind
This great grey matter
Sensei replied what is your woman
Is she just a container for the child
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Close my eyes & fall into you
My god she’s giving me pleasure

What if the sky & the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy maajin bu
Dim the lights & fall into you
My god giving me pleasure
Pleasure pleasure pleasure
Pleasure over matter

[Andre 3000]
Since you been gone
I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself naw
She’s better with some fella with a regular job
I didn’t wanna get her involved
By dinner mr. benjamin was sittin in awe
Hopped into my car drove far
Far’s too close & I remember
My memories no sharp
Butter knife what a life anyway
I’m building y’all a clock stop

What am I hemingway
She had the kind of body
That would probably intimidate
Any of ‘em that were un-southern
Not me cousin
If models are made for modeling
Thick girls are made for cuddlin’
Switch worlds & we can huddle then
Who needs another friend
I need to hold your hand
You’d need no other man
We’d flee to other lands

Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter
You’re good at being bad
You’re bad at being good
For heaven’s sakes go to hell
Knock knock knock knock on wood
Well frankly when that ocean so muphuckin good
Make her swab the muphuckin wood
Make her walk the muphuckin plank
Make her rob a muphuckin bank
With no mask on & a rusty revolver



Title: Forrest Gump

I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump, you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff, and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
I saw ya game, Forrest
I was screamin' run 44
But you kept runnin' past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips, they burn
From the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
Forrest green
Forrest blues
I re-mem-ber you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't for-get you (you)
(You you, oh you you) It's for you Forrest
(You you, oh you you) It's for you Forrest
Forrest Gump



Title: End

Darker times
They’re telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we’ve got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn’t compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don’t let him see divide
Don’t you let her see divide
Voodoo
She’s got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He’s got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She’s got the whole wide world in her hands
He’s got the whole wide world in his hands
There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' me this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see



Title: Golden Girl

(Bonus Track)

[Frank Ocean]
She peels an orange, for us in the mornin
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin
Like wildcats running on the grass (yeah)
You're a girl on this island, I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight
But I don't think I'm, goin backwards
I won't be goin backwards

[Chorus]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's gray
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (girl)
But the sky's never gray (never gray)

[Frank Ocean]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racin through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island, I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But, I know I'm not goin back home (yeah)
I'm not goin back home, no-ohhhhhhhh

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
If we don't have to live through Hell just to get to heaven
I'ma stay right here, with you, 'til the hurricane comes
'Til the tsunami comes, I've found my golden

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
Umm
You're my G-O, L-D, E-N, G-I, R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Thanks for fuckin with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see - I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't workin for my Kodak
So that, means that, I don't want to go back
Just know that, I would like to stay here and hold that
hand of yours - girl I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open
Fuck it let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I freefall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Umm, I trust you, Golden, for what
When I'm just hopin that you don't turn my neck green

[ocean waves, birds chirping]
[channel changed, LOUD BEEP]
